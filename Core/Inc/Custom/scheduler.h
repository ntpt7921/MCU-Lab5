/*
 * NOTE:
 * Here we define the required code and static variable for the cooperative scheduler.
 * A regular timer is required by this scheduler to run. A watchdog timer can be
 * configured to be used within this scheduler. It will reset the system if a task is
 * taking too long, using the IWDG timer
 *
 * Since we will only have one scheduler in the whole system, we don't need to package
 * all the required data into a separate struct. All we provide is a API for using the
 * statically allocated scheduler and its associated data structure (also statically
 * allocated).
 *
 * This cooperative scheduler support adding task (one-shot or auto-reload) with
 * duration and priority. Deleting task is also support. Both adding and deleting can
 * be performed when the scheduler is running.
 *
 * Policy for the scheduler, as mentioned is cooperative. Meaning that each task is run
 * until completion until finished. Only after that another can start running. Cooperative
 * policy opens the task to starvation.
 *
 * Each task is represented by a struct 'SchedTask_t', which will we stored in a
 * array representing a binary heap. The task have a runAtTick property to store the value
 * of tick that the task is scheduled to be run at.  Each task will take a function
 * pointer (with void * argument) and it is that function that will be called when
 * the task is run. Note that there is no counter within each task to count-down till
 * execute (but a system absolute timestamp (tick)).
 *
 * It is assumed the order established for the binary heap is provided by a comparison
 * function.
 *
 * The API for the scheduler have these function:
 * - Custom_Scheduler_Init()
 *   Initialize the system (regular timer, watchdog timer if configured).
 * - Custom_Scheduler_Update()
 *   This function is called in the regular timer ISR, it increments the global time for
 *   whole system.
 * - Custom_Scheduler_Add()
 *   This function add a 'SchedTask_t' struct within the priority queue (binary heap) and
 *   at the correct position. It takes various argument enough for establising a new task.
 *   Which is: task function pointer, argument pointer, priority value, period, delay (from
 *   scheduler start or from adding time) and task ID.
 * - Custom_Scheduler_Delete()
 *   Remove a task from the priority queue, taking the task ID identifying the task to
 *   remove.
 * - Custom_Scheduler_Dispatch()
 *   This function is intended to be called within the super loop, it will determined the
 *   next task to be run and run it. After finishing all task that are need to be run, it
 *   put the uC into sleep state until the system is wake up again by regular timer
 *   interrupt.
